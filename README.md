#How To: Plasmid Digest

Plasmd digestions are a simple process to verfiy a plasmid construct. 

(1) Obtain plamid for plasmid prep or collaborator. 

(2) Prepare a reaction mix with the following reagents:
   
    2ug 10x rxn buffer 
    2ul 
    0.5ul digestion enzyme
    add nuclease free water to 20ul
   

(3) Incubate the digestion reaction at 37C for 4 hours then cool to 4C for atleast 60 sec. 
	This is a good stoping point. The reacttion can be stored at 4C for up to one week and -20C for up to 2 years. 
	
(4) to validate digestion.  Preform gel electrophroeses usings agrose gel and stain. Depending the expected segment length, the percent of agrose gel changes.  for shorter segments, use a higher percentage gel.  For most uses, 1% argose gel is sufficent.  To make a 1% gel, boil 100ml of 1x TAE, and 1g of anhydrous agarose.  Then cool once dissolved to 40C. Once at 40C, then add 1ul of 1000x EtBr, a nucleotide stain to later visualize bands.

(5) Preform electrophorses in electrophorese appratus to sepreate segments based on size. Run gel at 100-150V for 60 min. 

(6) Image gel using chemidoc or film for anaylsis.  Once imaged, the banding pattern can be used to access plasmid construct. ![](PM9_copy.jpg)
